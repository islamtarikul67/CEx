1. UI/UX Fundamentals
Simplicity: Keep the interface clean and minimalistic. Avoid unnecessary elements.
Consistency: Use the same style for icons, colors, typography and layout throughout the product.
Accessibility: Make sure the interface is accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities.
Immediate Feedback: Provide visual or tactile feedback when a user interacts with the app.
2. Visual Enhancement
Colors
Use a consistent and harmonious color palette.
Limit the number of main colors (3-5 maximum).
Choose appropriate contrasts between text and background to improve readability.
Use colors to indicate states (e.g. green for success, red for failure).
Typography
Choose legible and purpose-fit fonts (sans-serif for screens, serif for print).
Use typographic hierarchies to emphasize titles, subtitles and secondary text.
Maintain appropriate spacing between lines and paragraphs.
Images and Graphics
Use high-quality images that are relevant to the context.
Incorporate graphics and icons only if they add value to the user experience.
Avoid visual overload: Too many graphics can be confusing.
3. Layout and Structure
Spacing: Use margins and padding to create balance and separation between elements.
Alignment: Keep everything aligned to give order and professionalism.
Grids: Use grids to organize content in a structured way.
Visual priority: Place important elements in key positions (e.g. above the fold).
4. Usability
Intuitive navigation: Create easy-to-understand menus and navigation bars.
Call to Action (CTA): Highlight main buttons and actions with distinctive colors.
Fast loading: Optimize performance to reduce loading times.
Preventable errors: Design systems that minimize user errors.
5. Feedback and Testing
A/B testing: Compare different versions of the interface to see which one works best.
Prototyping : Create prototypes to test ideas before fully implementing them.
Collect feedback : Ask users what they think of the interface and what improvements they suggest.
Continuous iteration : Implement changes based on test results.
6. Specific Things to Consider
Buttons : Are large enough to be easily clickable, with clear labels.
Forms : Reduce the number of fields needed; use autocomplete and real-time validation.
Mobility : Make sure the interface works well on mobile devices.
Animations : Use subtle animations to enhance the experience, but avoid excessive effects.
